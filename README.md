# AI Assessor â€“ Phase 1 (Written Communication, Critical Thinking, Inquiry & Analysis)

This scaffold gives you:
- Frontend (React + Vite + MUI) with a working mock scorer
- Backend (Express) with placeholder routes for /api/score and /api/rubrics

## Run Frontend
```
cd frontend
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Run Backend (optional during mock phase)
```
cd backend
npm i
npm run dev
```

Then change the frontend `App.tsx` to call your backend instead of `mockScore()` when ready.
