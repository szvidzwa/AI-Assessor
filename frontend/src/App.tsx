  const SAMPLE_ARTIFACT = `In this essay, we argue that urban green roofs can mitigate heat islands while improving biodiversity.
  We review prior research from 2010–2024, including Smith (2017) and Alvarez (2021), and several reports [1,2]. However, gaps persist regarding long-term maintenance and equity of access.

  Methods: We designed a mixed-methods study with 12 buildings, temperature loggers, and resident interviews. The methodology integrates an energy-balance framework and participatory design with local stakeholders.

  Results & Analysis: Average roof-surface temperature decreased by 7–11°C; moreover, insect richness increased by 22%. However, some sites showed no change due to irrigation failures. Consequently, adoption should include maintenance training. On the other hand, cost barriers remain for low-income housing.

  Limitations & Implications: Our sample is small and the monitoring lasted one summer, which introduces threats to validity. Future work should examine long-term performance and maintenance models.

  In conclusion, cities should prioritize incentive programs for green roofs while partnering with community groups to ensure equitable outcomes.`;
